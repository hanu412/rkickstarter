# React Kickstarter for projects

## Components included (05/19/2015):
- Bootstrap components, native to react so they can be replaced/extended as needed
- React router and react router bootstrap
- Basic react project structure, with sample pages
  - css folder for css pages. We are adding bootstrap.min.css as a starter point
- Webpack for bundling
- Babel.js, because we want to learn EcmaScript6 right?
- Note that I'm in no way an expert in React.js yet, nor any of the components mentioned above, so feel free to make corrections as you see fit.

## Update (05/20/2015):
- Initial commit to github repo. Package.json looking good, next steps is to build the sample app.
